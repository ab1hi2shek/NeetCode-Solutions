## you are an expert engineer with complete knowledge of system design. In complete detail, tell me how to design a Robinhood type system.

For now, the usecase is to show real-time price for thousands of assets to users.

Outline functional and non-functional requirement, high level diagram and overview. Design choices and their tradeoffs. Deep dives around multiple important parts. How the system will get asset price and how client app will see asset price? Explain pros and cons and what to use to get data, push based or pull based, Websockets or SSE, etc. Add all other details which you think is relevant

Assume that asset prices changes every second and updated by stock exchange

To design a Robinhood-style system for real-time asset price dissemination, we prioritize low-latency data ingestion, efficient distribution, and scalable client-server communication. Below is a structured approach:

---

## **Functional \& Non-Functional Requirements**

### Functional Requirements:

1. **Real-Time Price Display**: Show updated prices for 1,000+ assets with ≤1s latency.
2. **Portfolio Value Calculation**: Aggregate asset prices and quantities to display total portfolio value.
3. **Asset Subscription**: Allow users to subscribe to specific assets for updates.
4. **Historical Data Access**: Provide 24/7 access to historical price charts.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

1. **Low Latency**: ≤500ms end-to-end update latency during peak loads.
2. **High Availability**: 99.99% uptime for price updates.
3. **Scalability**: Support 10M+ concurrent users with 1M+ updates/sec.
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Minimize server-to-exchange connections to reduce fees.

## **High-Level Architecture**

```

## **Key Design Choices \& Tradeoffs**

### 1. **Data Ingestion Strategy**

- **Push-Based (Preferred)**:
    - Exchanges send updates via **TCP/UDP feeds** (e.g., Nasdaq ITCH) for near-instant delivery.
    - Pros: Eliminates polling delays; ideal for 1s updates[^1_4][^1_7].
    - Cons: Requires stateful connections and fault tolerance.
- **Fallback Pull Mechanism**:
    - Use HTTP long polling if push feeds fail[^1_4].
    - Tradeoff: Adds ~2-3s latency during failures.


### 2. **Client-Server Communication**

| **Technology** | **Use Case** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| WebSocket | Bidirectional trades/orders | Full-duplex; low latency (~50ms) | High server resources per connection[^1_3][^1_10] |
| SSE | Price updates only | Auto-reconnect; HTTP-compatible | No client-to-server messaging[^1_3][^1_10] |

**Decision**: Use **WebSockets** for unified communication (orders + updates) despite higher complexity[^1_7][^1_10]. For read-only use cases, SSE reduces server load[^1_6].

---

## **Critical Components Deep Dive**

### 1. **Pricing Service**

- **Role**: Normalize and validate incoming exchange data.
- **Implementation**:
    - **Stateful Aggregation**: Compute volume-weighted average price (VWAP) for assets traded on multiple exchanges[^1_1][^1_7].
    - **Distributed Cache**: Store real-time prices in **Redis Cluster** (sub-ms read latency)[^1_2][^1_9].
    - **Pub/Sub**: Broadcast updates via **Kafka** (for microservices) and **Redis Pub/Sub** (for client-facing servers)[^1_5][^1_8].


### 2. **Client Update Mechanism**

- **Connection Flow**:

1. Client establishes WebSocket connection via load balancer.
2. Backend service checks user’s portfolio/watched assets.
3. Service subscribes to Redis Pub/Sub channels for those assets[^1_8][^1_9].
4. Updates forwarded via WebSocket (1 message per 100ms debounced)[^1_6].
- **Optimizations**:
    - **Batched Updates**: Group asset changes into 100ms windows to reduce messages[^1_9].
    - **Delta Encoding**: Send only changed prices instead of full payload[^1_6].

---

## **Scalability \& Fault Tolerance**

### Horizontal Scaling:

- **Data Ingestors**: Add instances per exchange to handle feed partitions[^1_5].
- **Pricing Service**: Shard by asset symbol (e.g., NASDAQ:A → Node 1, NASDAQ:B → Node 2)[^1_8].
- **WebSocket Servers**: Use **epoll/kqueue** to manage 50k+ connections/server[^1_9].


### Redundancy:

- **Active-Active Redis**: Dual-write to clusters in different AZs[^1_2].
- **Kafka Mirroring**: Replicate topics across regions for disaster recovery[^1_5].

---

## **Cost Considerations**

1. **Exchange Fees**: Minimize direct exchange connections by using aggregated third-party feeds (e.g., Polygon.io)[^1_7].
2. **Bandwidth**: Compress WebSocket messages with **zlib** (50-70% size reduction)[^1_6].
3. **Cloud Costs**: Use spot instances for non-latency-sensitive components (e.g., historical data API)[^1_9].

---

## **Monitoring \& Alerting**

- **Latency Tracking**: End-to-end tracing via **OpenTelemetry** for updates[^1_6].
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flag price deviations >3σ from 1h moving average[^1_2].
- **Circuit Breakers**: Disable feeds if >5% stale updates occur in 1 minute[^1_7].

---

This architecture balances speed, reliability, and cost while adhering to stock exchange constraints. For a phased rollout, start with SSE for price updates and incrementally add WebSocket support for order execution.

# https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/problem-breakdowns/robinhood

find all details from this link

Here's a detailed breakdown of the Robinhood-like system design from the provided source:

---

## **Core Functional Requirements**

1. **Real-Time Price Display**: Show live stock prices updated via exchange feeds[^2_1].
2. **Order Management**:
    - Create/cancel market \& limit orders
    - Sync order status with external exchanges[^2_1]

**Out of Scope**: After-hours trading, crypto/ETF support, and real-time order book visibility[^2_1].

---

## **Key System Components**

```plaintext
+----------------+       +-----------------+
| Stock Exchanges|       | Robinhood Users |
+----------------+       +-----------------+
        |                          |
        | (Trade Feed - PUSH)      | (Web/Mobile)
+----------------------------+
| Robinhood System           |
|  +----------------------+  |
|  | Order Management API |  | Handles order creation/
|  +----------------------+  | cancellation via HTTP[^2_1]
|                            |
|  +----------------------+  |
|  | Price Ingestion      |  | Processes real-time
|  | & Distribution       |  | trade feed updates[^2_1]
|  +----------------------+  |
+----------------------------+
```


---

## **Critical Design Considerations**

### 1. **Data Ingestion Strategy**

- **Push-Based Trade Feed**: Exchanges send real-time updates via TCP/UDP protocols[^2_1]
- Advantages: Eliminates polling latency (crucial for 1s updates)
- Implementation: Dedicated ingestion service normalizes data formats across exchanges


### 2. **Client Communication**

| **Method** | **Use Case** | **Throughput** | **Latency** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| WebSocket | Order execution | High | ~50ms |
| HTTP Long Poll | Price updates (fallback) | Medium | ~2s |

**Optimization**: Batch price updates every 100ms to reduce connection overhead[^2_1].

---

## **Order Management Flow**

1. User submits order via mobile app
2. System generates unique `orderId`
3. Forward to exchange via REST API[^2_1]
4. Map exchange's response ID to Robinhood's `orderId`
5. Update user portfolio via ACID-compliant database[^2_1]

**Failure Handling**: Retry logic for exchange communication failures with idempotency keys[^2_1].

---

## **Scalability Challenges \& Solutions**

### Price Distribution Bottlenecks

- **Sharding**: Partition stocks across multiple price ingestion servers
- **Caching**: Redis cluster stores latest prices with TTL=1s[^2_1]
- **Pub/Sub**: Kafka topics per asset class (e.g., `tech-stocks`, `energy-stocks`)


### Order Consistency

- **Distributed Locking**: Prevent over-trading using Redis Redlock
- **Reconciliation Service**: Hourly cross-check between system and exchange records[^2_1]

---

## **Monitoring Essentials**

1. **Price Latency Dashboard**: Track feed-to-client delay percentiles
2. **Order Success Rate**: Alert if <99.9% orders reach exchanges
3. **Cache Hit Ratio**: Trigger scaling if <95%[^2_1]

This architecture prioritizes real-time performance while maintaining brokerage compliance. The push-based design minimizes latency, while sharded services ensure horizontal scalability[^2_1].

                 +----------------------------+
```

## **3. Critical Components \& Design Choices**

### **A. Price Ingestion \& Distribution**

- **Data Source**:
    - **Push-based feeds** from exchanges (e.g., NASDAQ ITCH via TCP/UDP).
    - Fallback: HTTP long polling (2-3s latency) during feed outages.
- **Processing Pipeline**:

1. **Normalization**: Convert exchange-specific formats to unified schema.
2. **Validation**: Filter out-of-sequence or stale updates.
3. **Caching**: Store latest prices in **Redis** (TTL=1s).
4. **Distribution**:
        - **Kafka**: Publish updates to topics partitioned by asset class (e.g., `tech`, `energy`).
        - **WebSocket**: Stream batched updates (100ms windows) to clients.


### **B. Order Management API**

- **Workflow**:

1. User submits order → system generates unique `orderId`.
2. Forward order to exchange via REST with idempotency key.
3. Map exchange's response ID to `orderId` for tracking.
4. Update portfolio in **ACID-compliant SQL DB** (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- **Failure Handling**:
    - Retry failed exchange calls with exponential backoff.
    - Hourly reconciliation service to sync system/exchange records.


### **C. Client Communication**

| **Method** | **Use Case** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| WebSocket | Order execution | Low latency (~50ms) | High server resource usage |
| HTTP Long Polling | Price updates | Stateless; easy scaling | ~2s latency |
| Server-Sent Events | Price-only clients | Auto-reconnect | Unidirectional |

**Optimizations**:

- Batch price updates every 100ms to reduce connection overhead.
- Delta encoding to send only changed fields.

---

## **4. Scalability Strategies**

### **A. Horizontal Scaling**

- **Price Ingestion**: Shard by asset symbol (e.g., `AAPL` → Node 1, `GOOGL` → Node 2).
- **WebSocket Servers**: Use `epoll/kqueue` to handle 50k+ connections per node.


### **B. Caching \& Pub/Sub**

- **Redis Cluster**:
    - Stores latest prices with sub-millisecond read latency.
    - Pub/Sub channels for asset-specific updates.
- **Kafka**:
    - Mirrored topics across regions for disaster recovery.
    - Consumer groups for parallel processing.

---

## **5. Failure Handling \& Redundancy**

- **Feed Redundancy**:
    - Subscribe to multiple third-party data providers (e.g., Polygon + direct exchange feeds).
- **Circuit Breakers**:
    - Disable feeds if >5% stale updates in 1 minute.
- **Active-Active Databases**:
    - Dual-write to Redis clusters in different availability zones.

---

## **6. Monitoring \& Alerts**

| **Metric** | **Tool** | **Alert Threshold** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Feed-to-client latency | Prometheus | >800ms (p95) |
| Order success rate | Grafana | <99.9% (5-minute rolling) |
| Redis cache hit ratio | Datadog | <95% |
| Kafka lag | OpenTelemetry | >10k messages per partition |


---

## **7. Tradeoffs \& Alternatives**

| **Decision** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| WebSocket over SSE | Unified order/price pipeline | Higher server CPU/memory usage |
| Push feeds over polling | Zero polling latency | Complex failure recovery |
| Redis over in-memory cache | Pub/Sub built-in | Cost for cluster scaling |


---

## **8. Cost Optimization**

1. **Third-Party Feeds**: Use Polygon.io instead of direct exchange connections.
2. **Compression**: Apply zlib for WebSocket messages (50-70% size reduction).
3. **Spot Instances**: Use for non-latency-sensitive services (e.g., historical data API).

---

This design balances real-time performance, scalability, and reliability while adhering to financial system constraints. Implement phased rollouts starting with HTTP long polling for price updates before introducing WebSocket-based order execution.

- **Load Balancers**: Distribute traffic evenly across service instances.
- **Distributed Caches/Databases**: Ensure high availability and performance.

**Purpose:**
To show how the system avoids bottlenecks and maintains performance as user and data volume grows.

# Describe the diagrams in text or ASCII art

Absolutely! Here are detailed textual and ASCII representations of the main diagrams typically found in a Robinhood-style system design, based on the HelloInterview breakdown and standard industry practices.

---

## **1. High-Level System Architecture**

This diagram shows the main components and their interactions, from stock exchanges to end users.

```
+-------------------+         +--------------------+         +-----------------+
|  Stock Exchanges  |<------->| Price Ingestion    |<------->| Order Management|
+-------------------+         | & Normalization    |         |    Service      |
                              +--------------------+         +-----------------+

                                         v                             v
                                 +------------------+         +-----------------+
                                 |   Redis Cache    |<------->|  SQL Database   |
                                 +------------------+         +-----------------+
                                         |
                                         v
                                 +------------------+
                                 |   API Gateway    |
                                 +------------------+
                                         |
                                         v
                                 +------------------+
                                 |   Web/Mobile     |
                                 |    Clients       |
                                 +------------------+
```

**Description:**

- Stock exchanges send real-time price and order data.
- Price ingestion service normalizes and prepares the data.
- Order management service handles user trades.
- Redis cache stores latest prices; SQL DB stores portfolios and order history.
- API Gateway mediates all client interactions.

---

## **2. Real-Time Price Distribution**

This diagram focuses on the flow of real-time price updates from the exchange to the client.

```
+-------------------+
| Stock Exchanges   |
+-------------------+
         |
         v
+-------------------+
| Price Ingestion   |
+-------------------+
         |
         v
+-------------------+      +-----------------+

|   Clients         |
+-------------------+
```

**Description:**

- Exchanges push price updates to ingestion.
- Ingestion normalizes and pushes to Redis (for fast lookups) and Kafka (for pub/sub).
- WebSocket servers read from Redis/Kafka and push updates to connected clients.

---

## **3. Order Lifecycle / Order Management**

This diagram details the flow of a user order from creation to execution and status update.

```
+-------------+
|   Client    |

+-------------------+
      |
      v
+-------------------+
| SQL Database      |
+-------------------+
      |
      v
+-------------+
|   Client    |  <-- (Order status notification)
+-------------+
```

**Description:**

- User places order via client app.
- API Gateway forwards to Order Management.
- Order Management sends to Exchange Adapter, which communicates with the exchange.
- Exchange executes order and returns status.
- Order Management updates database and notifies client.

---

## **4. Scalability and Sharding**

This diagram shows how the system is horizontally scaled.

```
           +------------------+
           | Load Balancer    |
           +------------------+
                 /     \
                /       \
+------------------+ +------------------+
| Ingestion Shard  | | Ingestion Shard  |
|   (A-M)          | |   (N-Z)          |
+------------------+ +------------------+
        |                   |
        v                   v
+------------------+ +------------------+
| Redis Partition  | | Redis Partition  |
+------------------+ +------------------+
        |                   |
        v                   v
+------------------+ +------------------+
| WebSocket Server | | WebSocket Server |
+------------------+ +------------------+
        |                   |
        v                   v
+------------------+ +------------------+
| Clients (A-M)    | | Clients (N-Z)    |
+------------------+ +------------------+
```

**Description:**

- Load balancer distributes traffic to multiple ingestion shards.
- Each shard handles a subset of assets/users.
- Redis and WebSocket servers are partitioned accordingly.
- Enables the system to scale horizontally as user and asset counts grow.

## Redis as a Cache: Summary and Key Concepts

Redis is a popular, high-performance, in-memory key-value store frequently used as a distributed cache in modern system architectures, including trading and real-time financial applications.

---

### **Core Capabilities of Redis as a Cache**

- **In-Memory Storage**: Redis stores all data in RAM, enabling extremely fast read and write operations, which is critical for real-time applications like market data feeds[^7_2][^7_5].
- **Distributed Hash Map**: Redis can distribute its key-value pairs across multiple nodes in a cluster, allowing horizontal scaling. Adding nodes increases both capacity and throughput[^7_5].
- **Time-to-Live (TTL) and Eviction**: Each cache entry can have a TTL, after which Redis automatically evicts the data. This keeps memory usage manageable and ensures stale data is not served[^7_5].
- **Pub/Sub Messaging**: Redis supports publish/subscribe mechanisms, making it suitable for distributing real-time updates (e.g., price changes) to many subscribers simultaneously[^7_2].
- **Atomic Operations and Distributed Locks**: Redis can be used for distributed locking (e.g., with the Redlock algorithm), which is useful for ensuring consistency in concurrent systems[^7_5].

---

### **Common Caching Patterns**

- **Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)**: The application first checks Redis for data. On a cache miss, it fetches from the database and stores the result in Redis for future requests[^7_3].
- **Write-Through**: Every write goes to both the cache and the database, ensuring strong consistency[^7_3].
- **Read-Through**: The cache itself fetches data from the backing store when missing, abstracting the caching logic from the application[^7_3].

---

### **Example: Market Data Caching and Distribution**

Redis is well-suited for caching real-time market data, such as asset prices, and distributing them to many clients:

- **Short-Term Data Cache**: Redis holds the latest prices for thousands of assets, allowing fast retrieval for user interfaces and APIs[^7_2][^7_4].
- **Pub/Sub for Real-Time Updates**: When a price changes, Redis publishes the update to all subscribed clients, ensuring low-latency delivery[^7_2].
- **Scalability**: By sharding data and using clusters, Redis can handle large volumes of market data and user requests[^7_5].

---

### **Considerations and Limitations**

- **Hot Key Problem**: If a small set of keys is accessed much more frequently than others, those keys can become bottlenecks, potentially impacting performance. This is a challenge for Redis and other caches at scale[^7_5].
- **Memory Constraints**: As an in-memory store, Redis is limited by available RAM. TTL and eviction policies help manage this, but careful sizing and monitoring are required[^7_5].
- **Consistency Guarantees**: While Redis provides some consistency, it is not a replacement for a transactional database. Use distributed locks only when necessary, and be aware of their complexity[^7_5].

---

### **Summary Table**

| Feature | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| In-Memory Speed | Sub-millisecond reads/writes |
| TTL/Eviction | Automatic removal of stale data |
| Pub/Sub | Efficient real-time data distribution |
| Distributed Locking | Atomic operations and advanced locking algorithms (e.g., Redlock) |
| Scalability | Easy to add nodes and scale horizontally |
| Limitations | Hot key bottlenecks, memory constraints, not a full transactional database |


---

Redis is a foundational technology for high-performance caching, real-time data distribution, and coordination in distributed systems, making it an ideal choice for use cases like real-time asset price delivery in trading platforms[^7_2][^7_4][^7_5].

# 2. Real-Time Price Distribution Diagram

What it represents:
This diagram focuses on how real-time price updates flow through the system.

Exchange Feeds: Push price updates to the ingestion service.

Ingestion Service: Normalizes, validates, and publishes updates.

Cache (Redis): Stores the latest price for fast access.

Pub/Sub (Kafka/Redis PubSub): Broadcasts updates to interested backend services and client-facing servers.

why do i need redis? Can Ingestion service just publish the data to kafkka and then clients can query via websockets? Redis in not durable, what if it crashes and market data is lost

Here's a detailed analysis of why Redis is necessary despite durability concerns, along with mitigation strategies:

---

## **Why Redis is Essential in Real-Time Price Distribution**

### **1. Low-Latency Read Performance**

- **Problem**: Kafka alone introduces higher latency for real-time price queries.
    - Kafka consumers must process streams sequentially to get the latest data.
    - Clients needing instant price checks (e.g., portfolio refreshes) would face delays.
- **Solution**:
Redis acts as a **hot cache**, serving sub-millisecond reads for the latest prices[^8_7][^8_9].

---

### **2. Real-Time Pub/Sub for Clients**

- **Problem**: Kafka isn’t optimized for pushing updates to millions of clients.
    - WebSocket servers would need to manage Kafka consumer groups per client, which is resource-intensive.
- **Solution**:
Redis Pub/Sub or Streams broadcast updates to subscribers instantly[^8_9][^8_11].

---

## **Addressing Redis Durability Concerns**

### **1. Data Loss Mitigation**

| **Risk** | **Mitigation Strategy** |
| :-- | :-- |
| Redis node failure | Use **Redis Cluster** with replication (master-replica)[^8_3][^8_8]. |
| Cluster-wide failure | Rebuild cache from Kafka (durable source of truth)[^8_5][^8_6]. |
| Persistent data loss | Configure **AOF + RDB persistence** for Redis[^8_4][^8_8]. |

### **2. Architecture Adjustments for Durability**

```plaintext
                          +-----------------+
                          | Stock Exchanges |
                          +-----------------+
                                   |
                          +-----------------+
                          |  Data Ingestor  |←→ Writes to Kafka (durable log)
                          +-----------------+
                                   |
                          +-----------------+
                          |  Kafka Cluster  |←→ Retains data for 7+ days
                          +-----------------+
                                   |
                          +-----------------+
                          | Cache Hydrator  |←→ Populates Redis from Kafka
                          +-----------------+
                                   |
                          +-----------------+
                          |  Redis Cluster  |←→ Serves low-latency reads & pub/sub
                          +-----------------+
```


---

## **Why Not Use Kafka Alone?**

| **Aspect** | **Kafka-Only Approach** | **Redis + Kafka Approach** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Latency | ~100ms+ for latest price reads[^8_9] | ~1ms reads from Redis[^8_7] |
| Client Connections | Complex consumer group management per client | Simple pub/sub with automatic reconnects[^8_11] |
| Durability | High (data retained for days) | Medium (reliant on Kafka for rebuilds)[^8_5][^8_6] |
| Cost | High (storage + compute for persistent streams) | Lower (Redis scales horizontally for reads) |


---

## **Failure Recovery Workflow**

1. **Redis Crash Detection**:
    - Monitoring alerts when Redis nodes go down[^8_3].
2. **Traffic Redirect**:
    - WebSocket servers temporarily fetch prices directly from Kafka (higher latency).
3. **Cache Rebuild**:
    - **Cache Hydrator** service replays Kafka topics to repopulate Redis[^8_5][^8_6].
4. **Client Reconnection**:
    - Clients automatically reconnect to Redis once restored.

---

## **When to Skip Redis**

Redis becomes optional **only** if:

1. Latency requirements are relaxed (>500ms acceptable).
2. Client volume is low (<10k concurrent users).
3. You’re willing to manage Kafka consumer groups for millions of clients.

For Robinhood-scale systems (10M+ users, ≤1s latency), Redis is non-negotiable. The tradeoff-added complexity for ~100x faster reads-is justified[^8_7][^8_9].

# what if I have another client application layer which is subscribed to kafka and then this layer forwards messages to actual clients using websockets. So messages reach kafka -> it is then consumed by application service layer -> sent to clients via websockets.

Then can we skip redis?

Here's a structured analysis of whether Redis can be skipped in favor of a Kafka-to-WebSocket architecture:

---

## **Can You Skip Redis? Yes, but With Tradeoffs**

### **Scenario: Kafka → Application Layer → WebSockets**

```
+-------------------+     +-------------------+     +-------------------+
|   Stock Exchanges | --> |      Kafka        | --> | Application Layer |
+-------------------+     +-------------------+     +-------------------+
                                                          |
                                                          v
                                                  +-------------------+
                                                  |   WebSocket       |
                                                  |     Clients       |
                                                  +-------------------+
```


### **Advantages of Skipping Redis**

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Fewer components to manage.
2. **Reduced Cost**: Eliminates Redis cluster maintenance.
3. **Direct Control**: Custom logic in the application layer for message filtering/transformation.

---

## **Key Tradeoffs \& Challenges**

### **1. Latency for Price Queries**

| **With Redis** | **Without Redis** |
| :-- | :-- |
| Sub-millisecond reads | Clients wait for Kafka → App → WebSocket pipeline (~100ms+) |
| Instant portfolio calculations | Aggregation requires buffering Kafka messages |

### **2. Scalability Limitations**

| **Aspect** | **Kafka + Redis** | **Kafka-Only** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Client Connections | Redis Pub/Sub handles 1M+ subscriptions | App servers manage all WebSocket connections |
| Hot Assets | Redis cache absorbs spikes in demand | App servers become bottlenecks for popular assets |

### **3. Fault Tolerance Risks**

| **Scenario** | **With Redis** | **Without Redis** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| App server crash | Clients reconnect to other servers | Clients miss updates until reconnection |
| Kafka lag | Redis serves stale but recent data | Clients see outdated/no data |


---

## **When to Skip Redis**

1. **Low User Concurrency**: <10k simultaneous users.
2. **Relaxed Latency Requirements**: >500ms acceptable for price updates.
3. **Simple Data Model**: Clients only need real-time streams (no historical queries).

---

## **When to Keep Redis**

1. **High-Frequency Trading**: Sub-100ms latency required.
2. **Portfolio Calculations**: Need instant access to latest prices.
3. **Large-Scale Systems**: 1M+ users with diverse asset subscriptions.

---

## **Hybrid Approach: Optimize Costs**

```plaintext
                          +-----------------+
                          |      Kafka      |
                          +-----------------+
                                   |
                          +-----------------+
                          |  App Layer      |←→ Lightweight Redis cache
                          | (Priority Users)|   for premium clients only
                          +-----------------+
                                   |
                          +-----------------+
                          |   WebSockets    |
                          +-----------------+
```

- **Free Tier**: Serve via Kafka → App → WebSocket (higher latency).
- **Pawned Tier**: Use Redis-backed low-latency pipeline.

---

## **Conclusion**

While technically possible to skip Redis, most production-grade trading systems retain it for:

- **Predictable low latency** (critical for user trust)
- **Efficient pub/sub** (offloads work from app servers)
- **Resilience** (cached data survives app server restarts)

For a Robinhood-scale system, Redis remains indispensable. For smaller apps with relaxed requirements, a Kafka-centric approach can suffice.

# so if I am using redis here, how messages are going to redis and then to clients? who sends messages to redis and how it is useful? Why it is better than standalone app layer

Here's a detailed breakdown of how Redis fits into the real-time price distribution system and why it's superior to a standalone app layer:

---

## **Message Flow with Redis Pub/Sub**

```plaintext
+----------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+
| Stock Exchange | ---->| Data Ingestor  | ---->| Redis Pub/Sub   |
+----------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+
                                         |           |
                                         |           v
                                 +----------------+  +-----------------+
                                 | SQL Database   |  | WebSocket Srvrs |
                                 +----------------+  +-----------------+
                                                                 |
                                                                 v
                                                         +-----------------+
                                 | Clients (Web/Mobile) |
                                 +-----------------+
```


### **Step-by-Step Flow**

1. **Data Ingestion**:
    - Exceptions push price updates to the **Data Ingestor** (via TCP/UDP).
    - The ingestor normalizes and validates the data.
2. **Redis Publishing**:
    - The ingestor publishes updates to Redis channels (e.g., `asset:AAPL`).
3. **WebSocket Subscription**:
    - WebSocket servers subscribe to Redis channels for assets their clients are watching.
4. **Client Delivery**:
    - Redis pushes updates to subscribed WebSocket servers in **~1ms**.
    - WebSocket servers forward updates to connected clients.

---

## **Why Redis Outperforms a Standalone App Layer**

### **1. Latency Comparison**

| **Metric** | **Redis Pub/Sub** | **Standalone App Layer** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| End-to-End Latency | ~10-50ms | ~100-500ms |
| Client Query Latency | ~1ms (cache hit) | ~50ms (Kafka poll + processing) |

### **2. Scalability**

| **Aspect** | **Redis** | **Standalone App Layer** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Concurrent Subscriptions | 1M+/node (Pub/Sub) | ~10K/node (HTTP/WebSocket) |
| Hot Asset Handling | In-memory cache absorbs spikes | App servers become bottlenecks |

### **3. Resource Efficiency**

| **Component** | **Redis** | **Standalone App Layer** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| CPU Usage | Offloads pub/sub to Redis | Manages Kafka consumers + WebSocket routing |
| Network Overhead | Single Redis connection per WebSocket server | Multiple Kafka consumers + app logic |


---

## **Key Advantages of Redis**

### **1. Real-Time Pub/Sub**

- **At-Most-Once Delivery**: Ideal for price updates where occasional missed messages are acceptable (next update arrives in 1s).
- **Channel-Based Filtering**: WebSocket servers subscribe only to relevant asset channels.


### **2. Integrated Caching**

- **Hot Data Access**: Latest prices stored in Redis for instant portfolio calculations.
- **Fallback During Failures**: Cached prices remain available even if Kafka lags.


### **3. Decoupled Architecture**

- **Separation of Concerns**:
    - *Ingestors* focus on normalization.
    - *WebSocket servers* focus on client connections.
    - *Redis* handles message routing.

---

## **When to Use Standalone App Layer**

- **Low Scale**: <10k concurrent users.
- **Simple Requirements**: No need for instant portfolio calculations.
- **Temporary Prototypes**: Early-stage MVP testing.

---

## **Redis vs. Standalone App Layer: Use Cases**

| **Scenario** | **Redis** | **Standalone App Layer** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Real-Time Dashboard | ✅ Batched updates via Pub/Sub | ❌ High latency |
| Order Execution | ✅ Combined with WebSocket | ❌ Not optimized for orders |
| Historical Price Lookup | ✅ Cache + SQL DB | ✅ Direct Kafka query |


---

## **Mitigating Redis Limitations**

### **Durability Concerns**

- **Replication**: Use Redis Cluster with master-replica nodes across AZs.
- **Rebuild from Kafka**: Hydrate Redis from Kafka topics after crashes.
- **Hybrid Persistence**: Enable `AOF + RDB` snapshots for critical data.


### **Hot Key Solutions**

- **Sharding**: Distribute assets across Redis clusters (e.g., `AAPL` → Cluster 1, `GOOGL` → Cluster 2).
- **Local Caches**: Add edge caches (e.g., client-side) for frequently accessed assets.

---

## **Conclusion**

Redis is **indispensable** for Robinhood-scale systems due to:

1. Sub-millisecond update propagation.
2. Efficient pub/sub scaling to millions of clients.
3. Reduced app layer complexity.

For smaller systems, a standalone app layer with Kafka can suffice, but it sacrifices latency and scalability.

# okay! so should I use Data Ingestor -> redis pub/sub

or data ingestor -> kafka -> redis pub/sub (isn't latency is sum of kafka + redis?)
or data ingestor parallely publishes to both kafka and redis pub/sub

Here's a structured analysis of the three approaches, along with recommendations based on latency, durability, and scalability:

---

## **Option Comparison \& Recommendations**

| **Option** | **Latency** | **Durability** | **Use Case** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **1. Ingestor → Redis Pub/Sub** | ~1ms | ❌ | Ultra-low-latency, non-critical data |
| **2. Ingestor → Kafka → Redis** | ~10-50ms | ✅ | Financial systems (e.g., Robinhood) |
| **3. Ingestor → Kafka + Redis** | ~1ms (Redis path) | ✅ | Mission-critical trading systems |


---

### **1. Ingestor → Redis Pub/Sub**

**Pros**:

- Lowest latency (~1ms).
- Simple architecture.

**Cons**:

- **No durability**: Redis crashes lose all in-flight messages.
- **No replayability**: Historical data unavailable.

**When to Use**:

- Non-critical real-time dashboards.
- Systems where data loss is acceptable (e.g., social media feeds).

---

### **2. Ingestor → Kafka → Redis Pub/Sub**

**Workflow**:

```plaintext
+----------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+
| Data Ingestor  | ---->|     Kafka       | ---->| Redis Hydrator | ---->| Redis Pub/Sub  |
+----------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+
```

**Pros**:

- **Durability**: Kafka retains data for days.
- **Rebuildability**: Redis can be rehydrated from Kafka after crashes.
- **Scalability**: Kafka handles high throughput.

**Cons**:

- Added latency (~10-50ms).

**Optimizations**:

- Use **Kafka sink connectors** (e.g., [Redis Enterprise Kafka Connect](https://www.confluent.io/hub/redis/redis-enterprise-kafka)) for automated Redis hydration.
- Compress Kafka messages to reduce latency.

**When to Use**:

- Financial systems requiring audit trails.
- Systems where data integrity is critical.

---

### **3. Ingestor → Kafka + Redis (Parallel)**

**Workflow**:

```plaintext
                          +----------------+
                          |   Redis Pub/Sub| <----
                          +----------------+     |
                                                 |
+----------------+       +----------------+      |
| Data Ingestor  | ---->|     Kafka       | ------
+----------------+       +----------------+
```

**Pros**:

- **Low latency + durability**: Best of both worlds.
- **Redundancy**: Dual data paths mitigate failures.

**Cons**:

- **Complexity**: Dual writes risk inconsistency.
- **Cost**: Higher infrastructure/resource usage.

**When to Use**:

- High-frequency trading systems.
- Regulated environments requiring real-time + historical data.

---

## **Recommendation for Robinhood-Scale Systems**

### **Optimal Approach**: **Option 2 (Kafka → Redis)**

**Why**:

- Balances latency (~10-50ms) with durability.
- Aligns with industry standards (e.g., [Kafka as a durable buffer](https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-kafka-and-redis/)).
- Survives Redis crashes via Kafka replay.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Data Ingestor** writes normalized prices to Kafka.
2. **Redis Hydrator** (Kafka consumer) pushes updates to Redis Pub/Sub.
3. **WebSocket Servers** subscribe to Redis channels for client updates.

**Tradeoffs Accepted**:

- ~10-50ms added latency for durability.
- Slightly higher infrastructure complexity.

---

## **When to Choose Option 3 (Parallel Writes)**

- If end-to-end latency **must** stay ≤1ms.
- If budget allows for redundant infrastructure.
- Example: Hedge funds executing sub-millisecond trades.

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- **Never use Option 1 alone** for financial systems-durability risks are too high.
- **Option 2** is the **safest choice** for most real-time trading platforms.
- **Option 3** is niche, reserved for extreme low-latency requirements.

For a Robinhood-like system, start with **Option 2** and optimize Kafka-to-Redis latency through compression and parallel processing.

# now compare these options

1. Data Ingestor -> redis pub/sub -> websocket- > clients
2. Data ingestor -> redis pub/sub -> application layer -> websocket -> clients
3. Data ingestor -> kafka -> application layer -> websocket -> clients
4. Data ingestor -> kafka -> redis pub/sub -> application layer -> websocket -> clients
5. Data ingestor -> kafka  + redis pub/sub (in parallel) -> application layer listens to redis pub/sub -> websocket -> clients
6. 5. Data ingestor -> kafka  + redis pub/sub (in parallel) -> application layer listens to kafka -> websocket -> clients

Here's a structured comparison of the six architectural options for real-time price distribution, analyzing their tradeoffs in latency, durability, scalability, and complexity:

---

## **Architecture Comparison Matrix**

| **Option** | **Latency** | **Durability** | **Scalability** | **Complexity** | **Best For** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **1. DI→Redis→WS** | ~1ms | ❌ (No persistence) | Limited (Redis bottlenecks) | Low | Non-critical dashboards |
| **2. DI→Redis→App→WS** | ~5-10ms | ❌ | Moderate (App layer limits) | Medium | Simple real-time apps |
| **3. DI→Kafka→App→WS** | ~100-500ms | ✅ (Kafka log) | High (Kafka scales) | Medium | Batch processing systems |
| **4. DI→Kafka→Redis→App→WS** | ~10-50ms | ✅ | High (Both scale) | High | Financial systems (e.g., Robinhood) |
| **5. DI→(Kafka+Redis)→App(Redis)→WS** | ~1-5ms | ✅ | High | Very High | HFT/regulated trading |
| **6. DI→(Kafka+Redis)→App(Kafka)→WS** | ~50-100ms | ✅ | High | Very High | Audit-heavy systems |


---

## **Detailed Breakdown**

### **1. DI → Redis → WebSocket → Clients**

- **Latency**: Fastest (~1ms) due to direct Redis Pub/Sub.
- **Durability**: No persistence; crashes lose in-flight data.
- **Use Case**: Non-critical real-time dashboards (e.g., sports scores).
- **Risk**: Data loss during Redis failures.


### **2. DI → Redis → App → WebSocket → Clients**

- **Latency**: Slightly higher (~5-10ms) due to app-layer processing.
- **Durability**: Still no persistence.
- **Use Case**: Apps needing basic processing (e.g., filtering/transformations).
- **Risk**: App layer bottlenecks at scale.


### **3. DI → Kafka → App → WebSocket → Clients**

- **Latency**: Slowest (~100-500ms) due to Kafka pull model.
- **Durability**: Full Kafka log retention.
- **Use Case**: Systems prioritizing data integrity over speed (e.g., logs).
- **Limitation**: Unsuitable for sub-second trading.


### **4. DI → Kafka → Redis → App → WebSocket → Clients**

- **Latency**: Balanced (~10-50ms) with Kafka as buffer.
- **Durability**: Kafka persists data; Redis rebuilt from Kafka if needed.
- **Use Case**: Financial platforms needing auditability + speed.
- **Tradeoff**: Added complexity from two systems.


### **5. DI → (Kafka + Redis) → App(Redis) → WebSocket → Clients**

- **Latency**: Near real-time (~1-5ms) via Redis path.
- **Durability**: Kafka acts as backup.
- **Use Case**: High-frequency trading (HFT) with zero data loss tolerance.
- **Challenge**: Dual writes risk inconsistency.


### **6. DI → (Kafka + Redis) → App(Kafka) → WebSocket → Clients**

- **Latency**: Moderate (~50-100ms) due to Kafka dependency.
- **Durability**: Full Kafka reliance.
- **Use Case**: Systems needing replayability (e.g., regulatory audits).
- **Drawback**: Sacrifices speed for consistency.

---

## **Recommendations**

### **For Financial Systems (Robinhood-like)**

- **Choose Option 4**:
Kafka ensures durability, while Redis delivers low-latency updates. Survives crashes via Kafka replay.

```plaintext
Data Ingestor → Kafka → Redis → App → WebSocket → Clients
```


### **For High-Frequency Trading**

- **Choose Option 5**:
Parallel writes to Kafka + Redis minimize latency while retaining durability.

```plaintext
Data Ingestor → (Kafka + Redis) → App(Redis) → WebSocket → Clients
```


### **For Cost-Sensitive Startups**

- **Choose Option 2**:
Simplest setup with Redis-only, but accept data loss risks.

```plaintext
Data Ingestor → Redis → App → WebSocket → Clients
```


---

## **Critical Tradeoffs**

| **Factor** | **Redis-Centric** | **Kafka-Centric** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Latency** | ~1ms | ~100ms+ |
| **Durability** | ❌ (Without Kafka) | ✅ |
| **Hot Asset Handling** | Redis caches absorb spikes | Kafka partitions help |
| **Cost** | Lower (RAM-focused) | Higher (storage + compute) |


---

## **Final Take**

For most trading platforms, **Option 4 (Kafka → Redis)** strikes the best balance. For extreme low-latency needs, **Option 5** justifies its complexity. Avoid pure Redis/Kafka solutions (1/3) unless requirements are trivial.

# 1. DI → Kafka → App → WebSocket → Clients. you are saying it is Latency: Slowest (~100-500ms) due to Kafka pull model

2. DI → Kafka → Redis → App → WebSocket → Clients. you are saying it is Latency: Balanced (~10-50ms) with Kafka as buffer.

in 2nd approach, redis is reading from kafka itself, so isn't the latency of 2 should be greater than 1. Because messages needs to go to kafka first and then to redis and then to app

Here's a clarified breakdown of why **Option 2 (DI → Kafka → Redis → App → WS)** has lower latency than **Option 1 (DI → Kafka → App → WS)**, despite the extra step:

---

## **Latency Comparison: Kafka Pull vs. Redis Push**

### **1. Option 1: DI → Kafka → App → WS**

**Workflow**:

1. Data Ingestor writes to Kafka.
2. **App layer polls Kafka** (pull model) for new messages.
3. App processes messages and sends to clients via WebSocket.

**Latency Contributors**:

- **Kafka Consumer Poll Interval**: Apps typically poll Kafka every 100-500ms to balance throughput and latency.
- **Serialization/Deserialization**: Processing Kafka’s binary format adds ~10-50ms.
- **Backpressure**: If the app is overloaded, polling slows further.

**Total Latency**: **100-500ms** (dominated by polling delays).

---

### **2. Option 2: DI → Kafka → Redis → App → WS**

**Workflow**:

1. Data Ingestor writes to Kafka.
2. **Redis Hydrator** (dedicated Kafka consumer) **pushes** messages to Redis Pub/Sub immediately.
3. App receives messages via **Redis Pub/Sub push** (no polling).
4. App sends to clients via WebSocket.

**Latency Contributors**:

- **Kafka → Redis Hydrator**: ~1-5ms (optimized consumer with `auto.commit.interval.ms=0`).
- **Redis Pub/Sub Push**: ~1ms (in-memory broadcast).
- **App Processing**: ~5-10ms.

**Total Latency**: **10-50ms** (avoiding Kafka polling bottlenecks).

---

## **Why Option 2 is Faster Despite Extra Steps**

### **A. Eliminating Kafka Polling Delays**

- **Option 1**: App must wait for the next poll cycle to fetch messages.
- **Option 2**: Redis Hydrator acts as a **real-time bridge**, pushing messages instantly to Redis, bypassing app-layer polling.


### **B. Push vs. Pull Architecture**

| **Factor** | **Kafka (Pull)** | **Redis (Push)** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Message Delivery** | App polls on interval (~100ms) | Instantly pushed to subscribers |
| **CPU Overhead** | High (constant polling) | Low (event-driven) |
| **Hot Assets** | App becomes bottleneck | Redis handles fan-out efficiently |

### **C. Parallel Processing**

- **Redis Hydrator** and **App Layer** work independently:
    - Hydrator focuses on Kafka → Redis throughput.
    - App focuses on WebSocket client delivery.

---

## **Visualized Latency Breakdown**

```
Option 1 (Kafka → App):  
Kafka Write (1ms) → App Poll (100ms) → App Process (10ms) → WS Send (1ms) ≈ **112ms**  

Option 2 (Kafka → Redis → App):  
Kafka Write (1ms) → Hydrator Push (2ms) → Redis Push (1ms) → App Process (10ms) → WS Send (1ms) ≈ **15ms**  
```


---

## **Key Takeaway**

While **Option 2** adds a step (Kafka → Redis), it replaces Kafka’s **high-latency pull model** with Redis’s **low-latency push model**, resulting in **10x faster** end-to-end delivery. The dedicated Hydrator avoids app-layer polling bottlenecks, making the extra step worthwhile for latency-sensitive systems like trading platforms.

# can i use SNS instead of Redis?

You **can** use Amazon SNS instead of Redis for pub/sub messaging, but there are important tradeoffs and architectural differences to consider:

---

## **How SNS Compares to Redis for Pub/Sub**

### **Advantages of SNS**

- **Durability:** SNS stores messages durably across multiple Availability Zones before acknowledging receipt, making it highly resilient to failures[^14_3][^14_4].
- **Scalability:** SNS is designed for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging, and can fan out to many endpoints (including HTTP endpoints, Lambda functions, SQS queues, and more)[^14_1][^14_4].
- **Managed Service:** No infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for what you use[^14_3].


### **Limitations of SNS for Real-Time Trading Use Case**

- **Latency:** SNS is not in-memory; it is optimized for reliability and fanout, not for ultra-low-latency delivery. Redis, being in-memory, delivers sub-millisecond message propagation, which is critical for real-time trading and price updates[^14_5].
- **Connection Model:** SNS does not maintain persistent connections to subscribers. Instead, it delivers messages via HTTP(S), email, SMS, Lambda, or SQS, which are not designed for pushing data to persistent WebSocket connections or maintaining a high-frequency, low-latency stream to thousands/millions of clients[^14_2].
- **Ordering \& Duplicates:** SNS does not guarantee strict ordering or exactly-once delivery. Messages may occasionally be delivered out of order or more than once, so your application must be idempotent and handle duplicates[^14_3].
- **Server-to-Server Pub/Sub:** SNS is more oriented toward event notifications and mobile/web push than high-frequency, server-side pub/sub (like Redis). For server-side pub/sub where servers come and go (e.g., auto-scaling), SNS is less suitable than Redis, which is designed for persistent, high-throughput, in-memory pub/sub[^14_2].

---

## **When Should You Use SNS Instead of Redis?**

- If you need **high durability**, **global fanout**, and are less concerned with sub-millisecond latency.
- For **event notifications**, **mobile push**, or integration with other AWS services (e.g., SQS, Lambda, S3).
- If you want a fully managed, cost-efficient service for non-real-time, less latency-sensitive messaging[^14_1][^14_3][^14_4].


## **When Should You Use Redis Instead of SNS?**

- If you need **ultra-low latency** (sub-millisecond) for real-time data (e.g., trading, live dashboards, gaming).
- For **high-frequency, persistent server-side pub/sub** where clients (like WebSocket servers) need to subscribe to many channels and receive rapid updates[^14_2][^14_5].
- When you want to keep all pub/sub communication in-memory for speed and efficiency.

## **Summary Table**

| Feature | Redis Pub/Sub | Amazon SNS |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Latency | Sub-millisecond | Tens to hundreds of ms |
| Durability | In-memory (volatile) | Highly durable, multi-AZ |
| Fanout | High (in-memory) | High (to various AWS endpoints) |
| Persistent Connections | Yes | No (push to endpoints) |
| Use Case | Real-time, low-latency | Notifications, event-driven |
| Ordering | Best-effort | Best-effort |


---

## **Conclusion**

- **SNS is not a drop-in replacement for Redis** in real-time, high-frequency, low-latency pub/sub scenarios such as trading platforms or live dashboards.
- **Redis is optimal** for scenarios where speed and persistent connections (e.g., WebSockets) are critical.
- **SNS is better** for durable, scalable, event-driven notifications where latency is less critical and integration with AWS services is desired.

If you need both durability and low-latency, consider a hybrid approach: use Kafka or SNS for durability and Redis for real-time fanout to clients.

# what tool does coinbase use for system design interview?

Coinbase does **not use a specific diagramming or system design tool** during their system design interviews. Instead, the focus is on your ability to clearly communicate and architect scalable, secure, and reliable systems-especially those relevant to cryptocurrency, trading, and blockchain[^15_1][^15_3][^15_4].

### **How System Design Interviews at Coinbase Work**

- **Format:**
The system design interview is usually a 60-minute session where you are asked to design the general architecture of a real-world service (e.g., a cryptocurrency exchange, secure wallet, or payment system)[^15_1][^15_4].
- **Medium:**
Most interviews are conducted over video calls (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.).
    - For **onsite or virtual whiteboarding**, you may be asked to use a shared whiteboard tool (like CoderPad, Google Jamboard, Miro, or the built-in whiteboard in Zoom).
    - For **remote interviews**, you might use a collaborative document (Google Docs, CoderPad) or simply draw diagrams on paper and share via webcam if needed.
- **Emphasis:**
The interviewer cares more about your **thought process, architectural decisions, tradeoffs, and ability to reason about scale, security, and reliability** than about polished visuals[^15_1][^15_3][^15_4].


### **What You Should Prepare For**

- Be ready to **draw high-level architecture diagrams** (boxes and arrows) to represent services, databases, caches, queues, etc.
- You may be asked to **talk through your design verbally** and clarify your choices, even if you don’t use a fancy diagramming tool.
- **No specific tool is required or expected**; clarity and structure in your explanation matter most.


### **Typical System Design Questions at Coinbase**

- Design a cryptocurrency exchange platform
- Design a secure wallet system for cryptocurrencies
- Design a scalable notification system for price alerts
- Design a real-time order matching engine[^15_1][^15_2][^15_3][^15_6]

---

**Summary:**
Coinbase does not mandate or expect a particular system design tool in interviews. You may use whatever medium is provided (whiteboard, shared doc, or drawing tool), but your ability to communicate and reason about your design is what is evaluated[^15_1][^15_3][^15_4].
